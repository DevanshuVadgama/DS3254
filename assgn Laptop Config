If my priority tasks are gaming, graphic designing, video editing, physics simulation etc. then I would require a very good CPU as CPU handles video editing,competitive gaming,simulations so I would go for Intel
i9 series (i9 14900K) (I am biased towards Intel processors as AMD processors heat up much more than intels :)) . Also for graphic designing I would require a good GPU so my choice would be 4090 8GB .
